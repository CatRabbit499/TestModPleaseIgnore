This resource pack is my (PeteZahHutt) personal alteration to Blocksmith's Blocksmith Hybrid texture pack, with a few added additions/replacements from miscellaneous other texture packs.

I take no credit for any of the items/gui's/blocks/animations/etc. in this resource pack, and give all credit to the original authors/artists.

If you wish to redistribute THIS version of the texture pack, please notify Blocksmith Hybrid through this link FIRST (http://www.minecraftforum.net/user/1931422-blocksmithed/),
and after you have been given explicit permission from Blocksmith, contact me via Twitter (http://www.twitter.com/PeteZahHutt) for further permission.
(This is not a complete confirmation from Blocksmith, however, he does request that all redistributions be pre-approved by him. My own permission is purely so I may know it is being distributed elsewhere.
